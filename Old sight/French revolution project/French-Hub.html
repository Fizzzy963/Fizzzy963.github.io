<h4>Note: the CNN page that this project is based on was captured by the Wayback machine it is what the website looked like on September 11th, 2001 the reason I did this is that during major events CNN will simplify their website to decrease load at least during the early 2000's this makes it easier to modify. Also, I chose to make it an old version because modern websites use JS frameworks and are not easy to modify. keep in mind that the links to "the full story" do not lead anywhere because it would be extremely difficult to wright news articles for every headline so all links on the page will lead to my personal website. lastly, on some of the dates, the smaller news stories on the side will be the same and not period accurate this is because this minor detail was extremely time-consuming and unnecessary. I hope this clears up any confusion and thank you for checking this out.</h4>
